SublimeRealTimePython
=====================

An experimental Sublime Text 3 plugin for seeing the values of variables as you code.

Through running this program in Sublime Text 3 the user is able to click on any variable in his or her Python code and the value of the variable as if the code had run up to that point will print out. 

Currently very much a work in progress. Currently working for basic assignments for ints, strings, and floats as well as simple operations to modify these types (+, -, *, /).

This project is for experimenting with real time code visualization.
